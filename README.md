<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p> The thermal buffering ability of ectotherms describes how their body temperatures are adjusted under varying ambient temperatures. Understanding how ectotherms buffer their body temperature is crucial and timely to precisely predict their responses to climate change. The thesis aims to identify the phylogenetic correlations between wing morphometrics (phenotypic traits) and the buffering thermoregulation ability of 71 butterfly species found in the Andean foothills. To do this, we first gather DNA sequences of the COI gene and reconstruct a maximum likelihood phylogeny. Afterwards, we measure the butterfly wing shapes and sizes and compile a dataset consisting of butterfly thorax and ambient temperatures recorded in the field in Peru. Finally, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to find statistical correlations between the butterfly thermal buffering ability predicted by the measured morphological traits: thorax cylindric volume (cm3), total wing area (cm2), wing loading (the ratio of thorax volume and total wing area), and aspect ratio (forewing length divided by forewing width). Our results show that butterflies with high aspect ratio, describing species with elongated and narrow wings, have high thermal buffering ability, i.e., they keep stable thorax temperatures across a wide range of ambient temperatures. These butterflies are often associated with long gliding flights, which might reduce heat production by having long non-flapping flight and decreased flight muscle activity. However, other morphometric traits were not associated with butterfly thermal buffering ability, despite previous predictions suggested a correlation between increased body temperatures and increased body sizes together with increased flight speed (assessed by proxy through wing loading). Thermoregulation is important for animals to adapt and survive environmental and climatic change. Our work provides a standardized and replicable approach for forthcoming studies on thermoregulation of butterflies, to assess the thermal buffering ability along environmental gradients in the tropics (e.g., along elevational zones) predicted by ecomorphological traits of ectotherm animals.</p>
