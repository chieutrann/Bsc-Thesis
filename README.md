<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p> The thermal buffering ability of ectotherms describes how their body temperatures are adjusted under varying ambient temperatures. Understanding how ectotherms buffer their body temperature is crucial and timely to precisely predict their responses to climate change. The thesis aims to identify the phylogenetic correlations between wing morphometrics (phenotypic traits) and the buffering thermoregulation ability of 71 butterfly species found in the Andean foothills.</p>
